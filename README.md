# antlrworks2
**antlrworks2** plugin for the **Netbeans IDE**

## Abstract

This repository is about building the antlrworks2 Netbeans plugin against all Netbeans platform versions (currently only for Netbeans 8.2 - we build against other Netbeans versions upon reguest).
**antlrworks2** (created by [Sam Harwell](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlrworks2)) is a Netbeans plugin that provides support for editing/development of ANTLR-based grammars/lexers.
I decided to build this project against Netbeans (currently only against 8.2) so that you can enjoy this plugin without diving into the problematic nature of this project (to be built properly - some people develop plugins that they cannot even know the underlying nature of the platform that they built it against - thus they put other people into troubles). That's why i decided to build it properly once and for all for Netbeans (currently only for 8.2).
